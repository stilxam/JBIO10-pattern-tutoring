Nicosia 2013 Vulka Bianco (Etna),Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Nicosia,Vulka Bianco,White Blend,87,,"Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimstone and dried herb. The palate isn't overly expressive, offering unripened apple, citrus and dried sage alongside brisk acidity."
Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),Portugal,Douro,Quinta dos Avidagos,Avidagos,Portuguese Red,87,15,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016."
Rainstorm 2013 Pinot Gris (Willamette Valley),US,Oregon,Rainstorm,,Pinot Gris,87,14,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented."
St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),US,Michigan,St. Julian,Reserve Late Harvest,Riesling,87,13,"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish."
Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),US,Oregon,Sweet Cheeks,Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block,Pinot Noir,87,65,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew."
Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),Spain,Northern Spain,Tandem,Ars In Vitro,Tempranillo-Merlot,87,15,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby."
Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria),Italy,Sicily & Sardinia,Terre di Giurfo,Belsito,Frappato,87,16,"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins."
Trimbach 2012 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),France,Alsace,Trimbach,,Gewurztraminer,87,24,"This dry and restrained wine offers spice in profusion. Balanced with acidity and a firm texture, it's very much for food."
Heinz Eifel 2013 Shine Gewurztraminer (Rheinhessen),Germany,Rheinhessen,Heinz Eifel,Shine,Gewurztraminer,87,12,"Savory dried thyme notes accent sunnier flavors of preserved peach in this brisk, off-dry wine. It's fruity and fresh, with an elegant, sprightly footprint."
Jean-Baptiste Adam 2012 Les Natures Pinot Gris (Alsace),France,Alsace,Jean-Baptiste Adam,Les Natures,Pinot Gris,87,27,This has great depth of flavor with its fresh apple and pear fruits and touch of spice. It's off dry while balanced with acidity and a crisp texture. Drink now.
