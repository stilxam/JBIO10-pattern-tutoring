    "\n",
    "On the 17th of September, 1944, the Allied forces in World War 2 launched a massive airborne operation with the goal of creating a salient into Nazi Germany, and provide a bridgehead across the Rhine river, a significant natural defensive barrier. This operation was called Market Garden.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to the success of the operation was securing crossings over the many canals along what is now knows as the A50, but during the operation itself was nicknamed Hell’s highway. Without the bridges, it would not be possible to bring in further support from Belgium, nor would the paratroopers get the relief they much needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look back at this operation now, we can observe that the main objective was a collection of bridges across some key locations. These objectives were set beforehand, and deviating from them later would be impossible, and as history has shown, would lead to disaster. These objectives were to be taken in a specific order, as they needed to form a continuous line between Belgium and the crossing over the Rhine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to represent these objectives in Python, we have seen several data structures already that could do this. For example, we could use a List.\n",
    "\n",
    "`objectives = [\"Wilhelminabrug\", \"Waalbrug\", \"John Frostbrug\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a list can always still be altered, and the order changed. We do not want this. This is where another data structure can come in: the tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "`objectives = (\"Wilhelminabrug\", \"Waalbrug\", \"John Frostbrug\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple in Python has some very nice properties:\n",
    "* It is ordered, similar to a list\n",
    "* It is immutable, meaning that once created the elements may not be changed anymore\n",
    "* It allows duplicates, meaning that in our case if there were bridges with the same names, we could have added them as well\n"
