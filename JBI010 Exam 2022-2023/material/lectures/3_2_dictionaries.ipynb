    "Samuel Johnson is the man behind A Dictionary of the English Language, the first definitive English dictionary. A Dictionary of the English Language, also called Johnson’s Dictionary, was first published in 1775 and is viewed with reverence by modern lexicographers.\n",
    "\n",
    "His dictionary was the first book to address English as it was written and spoken. It was the first to include context-based information about English, and, it was the first to attempt to enforce a standard of spelling and grammar upon unruly English, which had no equivalent of an academy to defend its use as proper or improper.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand Johnson’s undertaking, it’s important to understand the state of English lexicography in the middle of the 18th century. There were a handful of glossaries of difficult words, but overall, there was no reference for the English reader to consult words one might encounter on a day-to-day basis. In addition, books were becoming widely available and literacy in England was growing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several book publishers got together and commissioned Johnson to compile a dictionary similar to the one created by the French Academy. In France, that effort took 40 scholars and 40 years to complete, while it took Johnson nine years to complete."
